Inheritance:
    Is a mechanism in Java through which one class acquires the
    properties and methods of another class. It is one of the main pillar of OOPS.
Why we should use Inheritance:
    1) It helps reduce the amount of codes that we have to write.
    2) It is more efficient.
    3) Saves memory.
How we can use Inheritance:
    We can use the extant keyword after the class name and then the name of
    the class which we want to inherit the code.
class Parent {
String name = "Gevorg";
String eyeColor = "Black";
}
class Child extends Parent{

public void printInfo(){
System.out.println(name+" "+eyeColor);
}
}
Types of Inheritance:
    Different languages support different types of inheritances but 5 are very common.
    1) Single Inheritance.
    2) Multilevel Inheritance.
    3) Hierarchical Inheritance.
    4) Multiple Inheritance.
    50 Hybrid Inheritance.
Single Inheritance.
