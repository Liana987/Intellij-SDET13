Types of variables in Java:
    We have 3 types of variables 1) Local 2) Instance 3) Static

Local Variable:
    Re the variables that we declare inside a block of code
    upSide: They occupy the memory for shortest period og the time
    downSide: They can't be accessed outside of that block in which they are declared
Instance Variables
    Are the variables that are declared inside a class but outside a block of code.
    upSide: Can be accessed in all the methods of class. They can have different values
    for each instance of that class
Static variable
    All the variables which are defined outside of a block of code with static keyword they are
    called static variables.
    upSide:
    They only reserve a single memory location for all the instances of a class
    They can be accessed by just writing the name of the class and variable name
    downSide:
    They occupy the memory for longest period of time they always store only one value for all the object of that class.
Real Life use:
    Most of the times you will be storing constant values static variables
    Static is also used heavily with methods that don't
Accessed modifiers:
    There are 3 access modifier keywords(private, protected, public)
    and four access levels(private, protected, public, default) in Java.
Rules:
    Access modifier can only be used with instance and static members of a class(field and methods)
Private:
    When we use private with any method or variable we can only access that method or variable in that class
Default(it's not a keyword):
    We can access that member inside the same class the same package in the other classes
Public:
    When we use the public access modifier with members of a class it is available throughout that project.
Real life use:
    99% of the time instance fields are always private.
    99% of the time Instance and static methods are public.
