What is method overriding in Java:
    When same method with same header exist in the child class as well we call it method overriding.
Why we should override a method:
    If we inherit from the class all the methods which are not private they are inherited in the child class.
    If we don't like some of these methods because they consume more internet bandwidth or consume a lot of
    CPU or uses a lot of memory we can override them the child class
How can we use method Overriding
    1) We must first inherit from the class.
    2) We can redeclare the method with same header and provide the body of our choice.
Example:

class Parent {
void eat() {
System.out.println("I like to eat Beef");
}

void sleep() {
System.out.println("I like to sleep 8 hours a day");
}
}
class Child extends Parent {

void eat() {
System.out.println("I like to sleep 8eat Mutton");
}
Rules:
    1) We must have a super(parent) class derived class relationship.
    2) Method in the parent and child class must have same headers but they can be
    different in terms of access modifiers and in very rear conditions in terms of return type.
    3) We cannot change access modifier from public to protected or default but we can do it in reverse order.
    4) We can't override constructor because they are also not inherited.
    5) If a method is static we use a different terminology it's called method redeclaration instead of overriding
