What is super keyword:
    super keyword is used to refer to the parent class object.
Wgy should we learn super keyword.
    1) If we have same name variable or method in the super/parent/base class then we can use the keyword
    to refer to parent class variable or method because by default java prefers the variables of child class.
    We can also call the super class constructor with help of super with parenthesis super()
How to use super keyword:
    1) We can use super. method name or field name to call the method or to access the field of super class
    2) Use super with parenthesis to call the super class constructor.
Rules:
    1) We can only access the immediate parent class constructor or field or method with the help of super keyword.
    2) We can onl use super() inside a constructor.
    3) If we have a user created constructor in the parent class we must have a matching parameter
    constructor inside the child classes as well.
    4) If we have multiple constructors inside the parent ass soon as one is ,attached we are good to go.
    We don't need to match each and avery constructor from the parent class
    5) super() should be the first line inside a constructor.

What is MethodOverLoading:
    When same name method exists in a class but with different number of parameters or different type if parameters
    or different sequence of parameters it is called methodOverLoading.
Why we should use MethodOverLoading:
    1) Makes all your code readable
    2) Make the life of the end users easy they don't have to memorize many methods names.
How we can use MethodOverLoading.
    We can have same name method but we have to follow the below rules
    1) By passing different number of parameters
    2) We can change the datatype of parameters.
    3) We can also overload a method by changing the sequence of parameters
